JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT
-> IN TWO PHASE:
        1. GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT => {} -> THIS KEYWORD I.E WINDOW FOR BROWSER , JS IS SINGLE THREADED
        2. FUNCTIONAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
        3. (EXTRA MONGOOSE) EVAL EXECUTION CONTEXT (SIMILAR TO GLOBAL)

{} JS => 1. MEM CREATION PHASE (MEM ALLOCATION)
         2. EXECUTION PHASE (SUM,SUB,MUL ETC.)

e.g. let val1 = 10
     let val2 = 5
     function addNum (num1,num2){
        let total = num1+num2
        return total
     }
     let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
     let result2 = addNum (10ï¼Œ2)
    
1. GLOBAL ec -> THIS            // mem free after execution 
2. MEM PHASE (1st cycle)                    EXECUTION PHASE(2nd cycle)
        val1 = > undefined                  val1 = 10
        val2 = > undefined                  val2 = 5
        addNum = > definition               addNum -> another ec{new variable environment+execution thred}
        result1 = > undefined               result1 = 15 , result2 = 12
        result2 = > undefined
                                            MEM PHASE(addNum)                   EXECUTION PHASE(addNUm)
                                            val1 = > undefined                  num1 = 10
                                            val2 = > undefined                  num2 = 5
                                            total = > undefined                 total = 15 (return to GLOBAL ec)
